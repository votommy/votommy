# Hello!
I'm Tommy, a front end software developer based in Missouri. I enjoy open source projects and making web apps with a focus on user experience.

## Some of my Projects:
- [**Portfolio Website**](https://votommy.com): This site's purpose is to showcase my front end abilities while also displaying my professional portfolio and resume.
- [**Tetris-JS**](https://tetris.votommy.com): An ongoing passion project to clone Tetris in Javascript. It includes a database for storing scores.
- [**Cat Eyes**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cat-eyes-night-vision-toggle-mod): A client-side mod for Minecraft: Java Edition to make it easier for players to navigate poorly lit environments. Over 6,500 downloads.
- [**TommySans**](https://github.com/votommy/TommySans): A fully custom typeface (font) that I made specifically for use with my websites and personal documents. Every character was designed from scratch.
